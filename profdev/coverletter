Holding a computer science degree with a love for Databases, I joined a SQL development team in Ramco Systems. Having worked there for a year and seeing the data flowing in I realized I would find more satisfaction in analyzing the data. The move to Mu Sigma got me to work with data in trying to find insights for clients and make their business work. Finally looking for a more challenging role with greater responsibility, I moved to a startup and took up full responsibility for setting up their whole analytical system. Over the two years I got to lead business decisions and see them play out in the real world, I found myself lacking in business acumen. I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Analytics and hope to gain a broader perspective of the marketing world and apply those techniques to real world problems. The love for data is still as crazy as it always was, but now the love for real life business applications is driving me towards the next stage in life.
