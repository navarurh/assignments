Hi Anne,

I am currently pursuing my masters at UT Dallas and only constraint be able to join full-time from May 2019 onwards since I am on my F1 visa right now. If that is not a concern then I would be glad to have further discussions regarding the opportunity at Fidelity Investments. I feel my profile fits the job description well and my experience and education will be a good addition based on the requirements of the job.

Thank you for considering my profile for the role.

Regards,
Navarurh
