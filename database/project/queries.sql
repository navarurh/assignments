--1.  Write a query to display the current salary for each employee in department 300. Assume that only current employees are kept in the system, 
--    and therefore the most current salary for each employee is the entry in the salary history with a NULL end date. Sort the output in descending
--    order by salary amount.

    b.emp_fname as employee_first_name,
    b.emp_lname as employee_last_name,
    x.sal_amount as first_salary

        from salary_history a
        where a.emp_num = b.emp_num 
        and a.sal_from <= b.sal_from 
        order by a.emp_num,a.sal_from
    ) as ranked
    from salary_history b 
    order by b.emp_num,b.sal_from

where x.ranked = 1;

--    Write a query to display the customer code, customer first name, last name, full address, invoice date, and invoice total of the largest
--    purchase made by each customer in Alabama. Be certain to include any customers in Alabama who have never made a purchase 
--    (their invoice dates should be NULL and the invoice totals should display as 0). 

--7.  One of the purchasing managers is interested in the impact of product prices on the sale of products of each brand.
--    Write a query to display the brand name, brand type, average price of products of each brand, and total units sold of products of each brand.
--    Even if a product has been sold more than once, its price should only be included once in the calculation of the average price.
--    However, you must be careful because multiple products of the same brand can have the same price, and each of those products must be included in the calculation of the brandâ€™s average price.
