1 cleaned data removed all special characters using a python script to make it utf-8 encoding
- separated into the required 10 tables
2 invoice table had two invoices with the same number
	- kept the first created invoice based on date,customer number
3 there were 3 extra tab spaces at the end in dataset 3 that was leading to 3 empty/dummy columns being created
	- removed those before starting processing
4 removed an empty row from vendor table which was a copy for VEND_ID = 15 and had no data in the VEND_NAME and VEND_STREET fields 
5 changed employee_id to emp_num in invoice table
6 changed emp_num tp supv_emp_num in department table
7 fixed datetime field emp_hiredate in employee
8 fixed datetime field inv_date in invoice
9 fixed datetime field sal_from in salary_history
10 fixed datetime field sal_end in salary history
11 cleaned data in sal_end defaulting " - " to NULL
12 removed the not null condition from the constraints for the sal_end column in salary_history
13 There are no invoices with more than one line item which is very very weird
14 There are no sales beyond jan2014 so the 4th question gives a zero output
15 There are no invoices with sealer and top coat of the same brand in thems

?? fucking look at vend zip and other zips too i guess
?? need to create primary keys for tables that dont have one
?? connections need to be reverified
?? need to look at the constraints shit again
?? redownload the instructions thing and datasets again and rerun the whole thing

- created tables for each in mysql with the given constraints
- loaded data into mysql tables
- created ER diagrams using dbeaver
